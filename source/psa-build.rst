=============================================
Build the Percona Scheduler admin tool
=============================================

In the command line, run the following statement to initialize all
submodules and retrieve the latest code from the submodule:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $> git submodule update --init
   
Run the following command to build the scheduler submodule. 

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $> build_scheduler.sh
   
Percona Scheduler Admin has two main files: the ``pxc_scheduler_handler`` binary
and the ``percona_scheduler_admin`` script.

The ``pxc_scheduler_handler`` does the
following:

* Monitors the cluster's health
* Processes the cluster's state and evaluates the scenario
* Performs actions, such as failover in case of an incident

The ``percona_scheduler_admin`` script runs and provides responses based on the
configuration file for the ``pxc-scheduler_handler`` binary.

Running ``pxc_scheduler_handler``  without ``percona_scheduler_admin`` requires
manual intervention.

We do not recommend running multiple instances of the same binary. If you
attempt this task when an instance of
``pxc_scheduler_handler`` is running the binary runs, but the following occurs:

* Consumes network and system resources
* Returns the same results since the multiple versions use the same
  configuration file


The ``pxc_scheduler_handler`` binary is located in the base directory.

Create an ``admin`` user account. Use this account for communication through
proxysql and pxc_scheduler_handler.

.. sourcecode::


   mysql> CREATE USER 'admin'@'192.%' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password'
   by 'admin';
   mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'192.%' WITH GRANT OPTION;

See :ref:`locations` for known limitations.
