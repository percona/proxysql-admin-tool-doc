========================================================================
Summary of ProxySQL 2.x changes in the **proxysql-admin** tool
========================================================================

Added Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- New option ``--use-ssl`` to use SSL for connections between ProxySQL and the
  backend database servers
- New option ``--max-transactions-behind`` to determine the maximum number of
  writesets that can be queued before the node is SHUNNED to avoid stale
  reads. The default value is 100
- New operation ``--update-cluster`` to update the cluster membership by adding
  server nodes as found. (Note that nodes are added but not removed).  The
  ``--writer-hg`` option may be used to specify which Galera hostgroup to
  update. The ``--remove-all-servers`` option instructs to remove all servers
  from the mysql_servers table before updating the cluster.
- Hostgroups can be specified on the command-line: ``--writer-hg``,
  ``--reader-hg``, ``--backup-writer-hg``, and ``--offline-hg``.  Previously,
  these host groups were only read from the configuration file.
- The ``--enable`` and ``--update-cluster`` options used simultaneously have
  special meaning. If the cluster has not been enabled, then ``--enable`` is
  run. If the cluster has already been enabled, then ``--update-cluster`` is
  run.
- New command ``--is-enabled`` to see if a cluster has been enabled. This
  command checks for the existence of a row in the mysql_Galera_hostgroups
  table. The ``--writer-hg`` option may be used to specify the writer hostgroup
  used to search the mysql_galera_hostgroups table.
- New command ``--status`` to display Galera hostgroup information. This command
  lists all rows in the current ``mysql_galera_hostgroups`` table as well as all
  servers that belong to these hostgroups.  With the ``--writer-hg`` option,
  only the information for the Galera hostgroup with that writer hostgroup is
  displayed.
- New option ``--login-file`` reads login credentials from an encrypted file.
  If the ``--login-password`` or ``login-password-file`` options are not
  specified, the user is prompted for the password.
- New option ``--login-password`` is the key used to decrypt the encrypted
  login-file. You cannot use the option with the ``--login-password-file``.
- New option ``--login-password-file`` reads the key from a file using the
  specified path. You cannot use the option with ``login-password``.

Changed Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Setting ``--node-check-interval`` changes the ProxySQL global variable
  ``mysql-monitor_galera_healthcheck_interval``. Note that this is a global
  variable, not a per-cluster variable.
- The option ``--write-node`` takes only a single address as a parameter. In the
  singlewrite mode we only set the weight if ``--write-node`` specifies
  *address:port*. A priority list of addresses is no longer accepted.
- The option ``--writers-as-readers`` option accepts a different set of
  values. The values of ``--writers-as-readers``
  have been changed, due to changes in the behavior of ProxySQL between version 1.4 and version 2.0 related to Galera support. This option accepts the following values:

  +--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Option | Description                                                                      |
  +--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | yes    | Writers, backup-writers, and read-only nodes can act as readers.                 |
  +--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | no     | Only read-only nodes can act as readers.only read-only nodes can act as readers. |
  +--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | backup | Only backup-writers can act as readers.                                          |
  +--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  
- The commands ``--syncusers``, ``--sync-multi-cluster-users``, ``--adduser``,
  and ``--disable`` can use the ``--writer-hg`` option.
- The command ``--disable`` removes all users associated with the Galera cluster
  hostgroups. Previously, this command only removed the users with the
  **CLUSTER_APP_USERNAME**.
- The command ``--disable`` accepts the ``--writer-hg`` option to disable the
  Galera cluster associated with that hostgroup overriding the value specified
  in the configuration file.

Removed Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Asynchronous slave reader support has been removed: the ``--include-slaves``
  option is not supported.
- A list of nodes in the priority order is not supported in *ProxySQL* v2. Only
  a single node is supported at this time.
- Since the galera_proxysql_checker and galera_node_monitor scripts are no
  longer run in the scheduler, automatic cluster membership updates are not
  supported.
- Checking the pxc_maint_mode variable is no longer supported
- Using desynced nodes if no other nodes are available is no longer supported.
- The server status is no longer maintained in the mysql_servers table.

Limitations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- With ``--writers-as-readers=backup`` read-only nodes are not allowed. This is a limitation of ProxySQL 2.x. Note that backup is the default value of
  ``--writers-as-readers`` when ``--mode=singlewrite``
