`ProxySQL` is a high-performance proxy, currently for MySQL, and database
servers in the MySQL ecosystem (like Percona Server for MySQL and MariaDB). It acts as an intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the database. ProxySQL was created for DBAs as a means of solving complex replication topology issues. The `ProxySQL documentation <https://proxysql.com/documentation/>`__ provides information on installing and running ProxySQL.

The `ProxySQL Admin` (proxysql-admin) tool is used to simplify configurations of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with ProxySQL. 

The `Percona Scheduler Admin` (percona-scheduler-admin) tool is used to simplify configurations of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes into ProxySQL. This tool can automatically perform a failover due to node failures, service degradation, or maintenance.
