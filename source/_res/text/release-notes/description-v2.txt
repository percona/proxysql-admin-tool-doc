*ProxySQL* release , released by ProxySQL_, is now available for download in
the `Percona repository`_ along with an updated version of Percona’s
proxysql-admin tool.

*ProxySQL* is a high-performance proxy, currently for `MySQL`, and database
servers in the `MySQL` ecosystem (like **Percona Server for MySQL** and `MariaDB`). It acts as an
intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the
database. René Cannaò created *ProxySQL* for DBAs as a means of solving
complex replication topology issues.

The *ProxySQL* release source and binary packages available from the `Percona download page for ProxySQL 2`_ include `ProxySQL Admin` – a tool developed by
**Percona** to configure **Percona XtraDB Cluster** nodes into *ProxySQL*. `Docker` images are available as well.

You can `download the original ProxySQL from
GitHub`_. *ProxySQL* offers the `ProxySQL documentation`_. For more information on the issues fixed, features, or enhancements, see the *ProxySQL* |release| `release notes <https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases/tag/v2.0.17>`_
