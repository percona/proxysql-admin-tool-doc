DISABLED
   This is the default state that tells *ProxySQL* to route traffic to
   the node as usual.
SHUTDOWN
   This state is set automatically when you initiate node shutdown.
 
   You may need to shut down a node when upgrading the OS, adding resources,
   changing hardware parts, relocating the server, etc.
 
   When you initiate node shutdown, **Percona XtraDB Cluster** does not send the signal
   immediately.  Instead, it changes the state to
   ``pxc_maint_mode=SHUTDOWN`` and waits for a predefined period, which
   is determined by the value of the
   `pxc_maint_transition_period variable`_).  After detecting that the
   maintenance mode is set to ``SHUTDOWN``, *ProxySQL* changes the
   status of this node to ``OFFLINE_SOFT``, which stops creating new
   connections for the node.  After the transition period ends, any
   long-running transactions that are still active are aborted.
MAINTENANCE
   You can change to this state if you need to perform maintenace on a node
   without shutting it down.
 
   You may need to isolate the node for some time, so that it does not receive
   traffic from *ProxySQL* while you resize the buffer pool, truncate the undo
   log, defragment or check disks, etc.
 
   To do this, set ``pxc_maint_mode=MAINTENANCE``.  Control is not returned to
   the user for a predefined period (10 seconds by default).  When *ProxySQL*
   detects that the mode is set to ``MAINTENANCE``, it stops routing traffic to
   the node.  Once control is returned, you can perform maintenance activity.
 
   .. note::
 
      Any data changes will still be replicated across the cluster.
 
   After you finish maintenance, set the mode back to ``DISABLED``.  When
   *ProxySQL* detects this, it starts routing traffic to the node again.
