ONLINE
   Backend node is fully operational.
SHUNNED
   backend node is temporarily taken out of use, because either too many
   connection errors happened in a short time, or replication lag exceeded the
   allowed threshold.
OFFLINE_SOFT
   New incoming connections aren't accepted, while existing connections are kept
   until they become inactive. In other words, connections are kept in use until
   the current transaction is completed.  This allows to gracefully detach a
   backend node.
OFFLINE_HARD
   Existing connections are dropped, and new incoming connections aren't
   accepted.  This is equivalent to deleting the node from a hostgroup, or
   temporarily taking it out of the hostgroup for maintenance.
