Installation

ProxySQL is a high-performance proxy, currently for MySQL, and database servers in the MySQL ecosystem (like Percona Server for MySQL and MariaDB). It acts as an intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the database. ProxySQL was created for DBAs as a means of solving complex replication topology issues. The ProxySQL documentation provides information on installing and running ProxySQL.

The ProxySQL Admin (proxysql-admin) tool is used to simplify configurations of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with ProxySQL.

The Percona Scheduler Admin (percona-scheduler-admin) tool is used to simplify configurations of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes into ProxySQL. This tool can automatically perform a failover due to node failures, service degradation, or maintenance.
