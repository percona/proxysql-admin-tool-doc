[ProxySQL](https://proxysql.com/) is a high-performance proxy for MySQL and MySQL-compatible database servers such as Percona Server for MySQL and MariaDB. It acts as an intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the database. ProxySQL was created for the database administrator to solve complex replication topology issues.

You can [download the original ProxySQL from GitHub](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases). The [ProxySQL documentation](https://proxysql.com/documentation/) provides information on installing and running ProxySQL.

The [ProxySQL Admin (proxysql-admin)](proxysql-admin-tool-v2-config.md) tool simplifies the configuration of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with ProxySQL. [ProxySQL Admin 1](proxysql-v1.md) requires custom `Bash` scripts to track the status of a Percona XtraDB Cluster. [ProxySQL Admin 2](proxysql-admin-tool-functions.md) supports Percona XtraDB Cluster without custom scripts.

The [ProxySQL 2 and pxc_scheduler_handler](psh-overview.md) tool can automatically perform a failover due to node failures, service degradation, or maintenance. The pxc_scheduler_handler tool has different features and capabilities than ProxySQL admin. Do not use the options from one tool in the other tool. Mixing the options may cause unintended results.

## Release highlights

Compared to the previous [ProxySQL 2.5.5-1.2 release], this release includes all improvements and bug fixes available in [ProxySQL 2.6.2].

In this release, we are skipping ProxySQL 2.6.0 and 2.6.1. We are releasing ProxySQL 2.6.2, which is the latest ProxySQL release. This decision ensures that you receive the most up-to-date features and improvements.

The improvements and bug fixes introduced by ProxySQL 2.6.2 and included in this release are:

- Support for [`caching_sha2_passwords`] for frontend and backend connections. Setting the `mysql-default_authentication_plugin` to `caching_sha2_passwords` automatically enables SSL for frontend connections. Using this setting reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. The setting is compatible with MySQL 8.0 and above.

- Added new SQLite3 functions to support [password management].

- New feature
  [`mysql_servers_ssl_params`](https://proxysql.com/documentation/main-runtime/#mysql_servers_ssl_params) - controls the SSL parameters in a per-host basis.

- Added
  [`mysql-default_authentication_plugin`](https://proxysql.com/documentation/global-variables/mysql-variables/#mysql-default_authentication_plugin) - controls which authentication method is sent to the client in the `Initial Handshake packet`. 

- Improved LDAP support with the LDAP Plugin. The [`admin--checksum_ldap_variables`](https://proxysql.com/documentation/global-variables/admin-variables/) global variable enables LDAP variables to be synchronized by ProxySQL Cluster if the LSAP Plugin is enabled.

- Deprecated
  [`admin-hash_passwords`](https://proxysql.com/documentation/global-variables/admin-variables/#admin-hash_passwords-deprecated) - A user can store the passwords in clear text or with a hashing method, depending on the user's preference.

For more information on these items and other changes, see the [ProxySQL 2.6.2 release notes](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases/tag/v2.6.2).
