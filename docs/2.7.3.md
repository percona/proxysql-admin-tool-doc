## Release highlights

In this release, we are skipping [ProxySQL 2.7.2]. We are releasing ProxySQL 2.7.3., which is the latest ProxySQL release. This decision ensures that you receive the most up-to-date features and improvements. Compared to the previous [ProxySQL 2.7.1-1 release], this release includes all improvements and bug fixes available in [ProxySQL 2.7.2] and [ProxySQL 2.7.3].

* Added a configurable feature for logging and analyzing events and queries, providing real-time understanding of how applications are interacting with the database and its performance.

* Added support for PMM metrics (`runtime_mysql_servers_*`) through the Prometheus exporter, helping you monitor and troubleshoot your database efficiently.

* Introduced flexibility in query configurations with support for `@@session` and `@global` variables in `SET` statements.

* Resolved collation mismatches between the client (frontend) and the server (backend) when collation IDs exceed 255, ensuring consistent query results.

* Fixed issues with DELETE operations in the stats memory database, improving reliability during maintenance tasks.
