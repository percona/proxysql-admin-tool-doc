--8<--- "rn-block-top.md"

## Release highlights

This release introduces Percona's build of ProxySQL 2.7.3, incorporating the latest upstream features and improvements. Instead of releasing a Percona build of ProxySQL 2.7.2, we are skipping to 2.7.3. This version includes all enhancements and bug fixes from upstream [ProxySQL 2.7.2] and [ProxySQL 2.7.3].

* Added a configurable feature for logging and analyzing events and queries, providing real-time understanding of how applications are interacting with the database and its performance.

* Added support for PMM metrics (`runtime_mysql_servers_*`) through the Prometheus exporter, helping you monitor and troubleshoot your database efficiently.

* Introduced flexibility in query configurations with support for `@@session` and `@global` variables in `SET` statements.

* Resolved collation mismatches between the client (frontend) and the server (backend) when collation IDs exceed 255, ensuring consistent query results.

* Fixed issues with DELETE operations in the stats memory database, improving reliability during maintenance tasks.

### No changes

The [ProxySQL Admin] tool and the [pxc_scheduler_handler] tool within Percona's Build of ProxySQL 2.7.3 have not been updated and are the same as in the previous Percona release.
