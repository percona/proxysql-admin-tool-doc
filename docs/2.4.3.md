# ProxySQL 2.4.3 and ProxySQL admin tools (2022-08-31)

[ProxySQL](https://proxysql.com/) is a high-performance proxy for MySQL and MySQL-compatible database servers such as Percona Server for MySQL and MariaDB. It acts as an intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the database. ProxySQL was created for the database administrator as a solution for complex replication topology issues. 

You can [download the original ProxySQL from GitHub](<https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases>). The [ProxySQL documentation](https://proxysql.com/documentation/) provides information on installing and running ProxySQL. 

The [ProxySQL Admin (proxysql-admin)](https://docs.percona.com/proxysql/v2-config.html) tool simplifies the configuration of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with ProxySQL. [ProxySQL Admin 1.x.x](https://docs.percona.com/proxysql/proxysql-v1.html) requires custom `Bash` scripts to track the status of a Percona XtraDB Cluster. [ProxySQL Admin 2.x.x](https://docs.percona.com/proxysql/psql-functions.html) supports Percona XtraDB Cluster without custom scripts.

The [Percona Scheduler Admin (percona-scheduler-admin)](https://docs.percona.com/proxysql/psa-scheduler.html) tool can automatically perform a failover due to node failures, service degradation, or maintenance.

!!! note

    Percona Scheduler admin has different features and capabilities than  ProxySQL admin. Do not use the options from one tool in the other tool. Mixing the options may cause unintended results.

## Bug fixes

* [psqladm-402](https://jira.percona.com/browse/psqladm-402): The `proxysql-status` command did not work as intended. The script had a requirement to pass the .cnf file but this requirement is no longer needed.

* [psqladm-419](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PSQLADM-419): The CVE-2021-38561 was found in a library used by `pxc_scheduler_handler`. The appropriate patch was applied.
