# ProxySQL 2.4.2 and proxysql admin tools (2022-08-10)

[ProxySQL](https://proxysql.com/) is a high-performance proxy for MySQL and MySQL-compatible database servers such as Percona Server for MySQL and MariaDB. It acts as an intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the database. ProxySQL was created for DBAs as a means of solving complex replication topology issues. 

You can [download the original ProxySQL from GitHub](<https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases>). The [ProxySQL documentation](https://proxysql.com/documentation/) provides information on installing and running ProxySQL. 

The [ProxySQL Admin (proxysql-admin)](https://docs.percona.com/proxysql/v2-config.html) tool simplifies the configuration of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with ProxySQL. [ProxySQL Admin 1.x.x](https://docs.percona.com/proxysql/proxysql-v1.html) requires custom `Bash` scripts to track the status of a Percona XtraDB Cluster. [ProxySQL Admin 2.x.x](https://docs.percona.com/proxysql/psql-functions.html) supports Percona XtraDB Cluster without custom scripts.

The [Percona Scheduler Admin (percona-scheduler-admin)](https://docs.percona.com/proxysql/psa-scheduler.html) tool  can automatically perform a failover due to node failures, service degradation, or maintenance.

!!! note

    *Percona Scheduler admin* has different features and 
    capabilities then *ProxySQL admin*. Do not use the options from one 
    tool in the other tool. Mixing the options may cause unintended results.

## Release highlights

This release includes all features and bug fixes available in ProxySQL 2.4.0, ProxySQL 2.4.1, and ProxySQL 2.4.2. 

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by *ProxySQL* and included in this release are:

* Adds `transaction_isolation` to the list of session variables that do not disable multiplexing in ProxySQL
* Improves the startup time when multiple listeners are configured
* Improved code quality 

For more information on the issues fixed, features, or enhancements, 
see the *ProxySQL* [2.4.0 release notes](<https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases/tag/v2.4.0>), the
*ProxySQL* [2.4.1 Release notes](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases/tag/v2.4.1), and the *ProxySQL* [2.4.2 Release notes](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases/tag/v2.4.2).


**ProxySQL Admin** and **Percona Scheduler admin** have not changed since the previous release.

!!! note 

    An upgrade from ProxySQL v1.x to ProxySQL v2.x requires the user to manually remove the ProxySQL v1.x packages. After that operation, the user can install ProxySQL v2.x.

## Improvements

When ``pxc_scheduler_handler`` launches, a lock file is created to prevent the running of multiple instances of ``pxc_scheduler_handler``. Previously, the lock file remained in the file system and prevented the handler script from running. 

Now, on startup, ``pxc_scheduler_handler`` does the following:

* reads the Process identifier (PID), 
* reads the timestamp from the lock file, 
* checks if PID is running on startup. 

If PID is still running, the newly launched ``pxc_scheduler_handler`` exits. If the PID is not running, ``pxc_scheduler_handler`` checks whether the timeout specified in `lockFileTimeout` exceeds. If the timeout exceeds, ``pxc_scheduler_handler`` removes the lock file and performs the operations.
