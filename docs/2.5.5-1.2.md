# ProxySQL 2.5.5-1.2 and ProxySQL admin tools (2024-02-26)

[ProxySQL](https://proxysql.com/) is a high-performance proxy for MySQL and MySQL-compatible database servers such as Percona Server for MySQL and MariaDB. It acts as an intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the database. ProxySQL was created for the database administrator as a solution for complex replication topology issues.

You can [download the original ProxySQL from GitHub](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases). The [ProxySQL documentation](https://proxysql.com/documentation/) provides information on installing and running ProxySQL.

The [ProxySQL Admin (proxysql-admin)](proxysql-admin-tool-v2-config.md) tool simplifies the configuration of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with ProxySQL. [ProxySQL Admin 2.x.x](proxysql-admin-tool-functions.md) supports Percona XtraDB Cluster without custom scripts.

The [ProxySQL 2 and pxc_scheduler_handler](psh-overview.md) tool can automatically perform a failover due to node failures, service degradation, or maintenance. The pxc_scheduler_handler tool has different features and capabilities than ProxySQL admin. Do not use the options from one tool in the other tool. Mixing the options may cause unintended results.

## Release highlights

This release updates the Percona scripts with [bug fixes](#bug-fixes) and adds the `LockRefreshTime` variable.

## Bug Fixes

[PSQLADM-501] : Fixed the issue with `--syncusers` which created additional users in the `mysql_users` table when more than one admin user were defined in admin-admin_credentials. Thanks to [Roberto Garcia de bem](https://github.com/Robertoh98) for the contribution.

[PSQLADM-502] : Support for MariaDB 10.11 in using ProxySQL admin (customer request). Thanks to [PN Morin](https://github.com/Pinimo) for the contribution.

[PSQLADM-506] : Updated systemd file from proxysql sources. Systemd file that is shipped by Percona was different from what was shipped by ProxySQL.

[pxc_scheudler_handler FR#71] :  Adds the following:

* Support to delay the epoch flush

* A new variable `LockRefreshTime`, which is time in seconds after which the scheduler will refresh the epoch inside the ProxySQL server table. This parameter was introduced to reduce the frequency of updates in ProxySQL.
