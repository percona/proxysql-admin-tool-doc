--8<--- "rn-block-top.md"

## Release highlights

This release updates the Percona scripts with [bug fixes](#bug-fixes) and adds the `LockRefreshTime` variable.

## Bug Fixes

[PSQLADM-501] : Fixed the issue with `--syncusers` which created additional users in the `mysql_users` table when more than one admin user were defined in admin-admin_credentials. Thanks to [Roberto Garcia de bem](https://github.com/Robertoh98) for the contribution.

[PSQLADM-502] : Support for MariaDB 10.11 in using ProxySQL admin (customer request). Thanks to [PN Morin](https://github.com/Pinimo) for the contribution.

[PSQLADM-506] : Updated systemd file from proxysql sources. Systemd file that is shipped by Percona was different from what was shipped by ProxySQL.

[pxc_scheudler_handler FR#71] :  Adds the following:

* Support to delay the epoch flush

* A new variable `LockRefreshTime`, which is time in seconds after which the scheduler will refresh the epoch inside the ProxySQL server table. This parameter was introduced to reduce the frequency of updates in ProxySQL.
