#  Percona's build of ProxySQL 2.7.1 and ProxySQL admin tools (2024-10-28)

--8<--- "rn-block-top.md"

## Release highlights

Compared to the previous [ProxySQL 2.6.5 release], this release includes all improvements and bug fixes available in [ProxySQL 2.7.0] and [ProxySQL 2.7.1].

* ProxySQL now works with PROXY protocol version 1. This ability helps applications behind load balancers see the real IP address of clients. Here's what this means:

* You can make rules based on the client IP addresses for actions like caching and routing.

* The process list and audit logs show the actual client IP addresses.

* You can limit database access based on client IP addresses for better security.

* You can track where database connections come from, helping you find performance issues tied to specific clients.

* If a MySQL connection fails or times out for a certain hostname, the DNS record for that hostname is removed. This removal prevents keeping old or invalid DNS records. 

* The DNS caching feature is automatically turned off when ProxySQL starts with the `-M` or `--no-monitor` option.

## Bug fixes

* [PSQLADM-525]: Use the HEX() and UNHEX() functions to convert password fields. This ability will help fix problems with escape characters and other special symbols.
