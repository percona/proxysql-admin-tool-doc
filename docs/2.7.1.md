[ProxySQL](https://proxysql.com/) is a high-performance proxy for MySQL and MySQL-compatible database servers such as Percona Server for MySQL and MariaDB. It acts as an intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the database. ProxySQL was created for the database administrator to solve complex replication topology issues.

You can [download the original ProxySQL from GitHub](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases). The [ProxySQL documentation](https://proxysql.com/documentation/) provides information on installing and running ProxySQL.

The [ProxySQL Admin (proxysql-admin)](proxysql-admin-tool-v2-config.md) tool simplifies the configuration of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with ProxySQL. [ProxySQL Admin 1](proxysql-v1.md) requires custom `Bash` scripts to track the status of a Percona XtraDB Cluster. [ProxySQL Admin 2](proxysql-admin-tool-functions.md) supports Percona XtraDB Cluster without custom scripts.

The [ProxySQL 2 and pxc_scheduler_handler](psh-overview.md) tool can automatically perform a failover due to node failures, service degradation, or maintenance. The pxc_scheduler_handler tool has different features and capabilities than ProxySQL admin. Do not use the options from one tool in the other tool. Mixing the options may cause unintended results.

## Release highlights

Compared to the previous [ProxySQL 2.6.5 release], this release includes all improvements and bug fixes available in [ProxySQL 2.7.0] and [ProxySQL 2.7.1].

* ProxySQL now works with PROXY protocol version 1. This ability helps applications behind load balancers see the real IP address of clients. Here's what this means:

* You can make rules based on the client IP addresses for actions like caching and routing.

* The process list and audit logs show the actual client IP addresses.

* You can limit database access based on client IP addresses for better security.

* You can track where database connections come from, helping you find performance issues tied to specific clients.

* If a MySQL connection fails or times out for a certain hostname, the DNS record for that hostname is removed. This removal prevents keeping old or invalid DNS records. 

* The DNS caching feature is turned off automatically when ProxySQL is started with the `-M` or `--no-monitor` option.

In an MySQL 8.4 or Percona Server for MySQL 8.4 environment, you may have the following issues:

* ProxySQL contains counters that have not been updated to use the new terminology. Unexpected results may occur
* The binlog reader errors out during initialization due to the use of the old terminology, such as SHOW MASTER STATUS command.

## Bug fixes

* [PSQLADM-525]: Use the HEX() and UNHEX() functions to convert password fields. This ability will help fix problems with escape characters and other special symbols.
