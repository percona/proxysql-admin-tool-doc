#  Percona's build of ProxySQL 2.6.5 and ProxySQL admin tools (2024-09-12)

--8<--- "rn-block-top.md"

## Release highlights

Compared to the previous [ProxySQL 2.6.3 release], this release includes all improvements and bug fixes available in [ProxySQL 2.6.4] and [ProxySQL 2.6.5].

In this release, we are skipping ProxySQL 2.6.4. We are releasing ProxySQL 2.6.5, which is the latest ProxySQL release. This decision ensures that you receive the most up-to-date features and improvements.

* Upgraded OpenSSL to version 3.3.1.

* Added compatibility for Ubuntu 24 and Fedora 40.

* The system now correctly handles the `USE` command when it ends with a semicolon. It removes any trailing semicolon automatically. Additionally, the system will now return an error if someone tries to use the USE command as part of a multi-statement query.

* In versions 2.5.2 through 2.6.4, the `stats_mysql_query_digest.digest` feature generated lowercase output when it should have been uppercase.


## Bug fixes

* [PSQLADM-518](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PSQLADM-518): Adds a systemd unit `proxysql-initial.service` that can be used to re-initialize ProxySQL from the config file (after first startup the DB file is used instead of the config file). For usage, please refer to [ProxySQL Getting Started - Reinitializing ProxySQL from the config file](https://proxysql.com/documentation/getting-started/#:~:text=Reinitializing%20ProxySQL%20from%20the%20config%20file])
